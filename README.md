Crosswords With Gemini

I love doing crosswords from places like the NYT because they're a fun way to learn and retain all sorts of information, from historical trivia to current events. My tool would let a user select a theme, like "Grade 3 Biology" or "Last Week's Sports News," and then it would generate a crossword puzzle of a chosen size (3x3, 6x6, or 9x9).

The core of this tool would be its ability to adapt and reuse knowledge. It would include a learning trajectory for each user. For example, if a user has done crosswords on "Grade 3 Biology" and "the Solar System," the next crossword on "Cameras" might include some clues from those previous themes. This feature would help reinforce and retain previously learned knowledge. The themes offered would be very diverse, spanning history, politics, finance, and various school subjects. There will also be a repository of crosswords on the application that new users can choose from, which will be continuously added to, if the user does not want to create a theme themselves.

The generation process: An algorithm would handle the grid layout. I'd use the Gemini API to generate the main, theme-specific words, and a dictionary API to fill in the rest, including words from past themes. Once the grid is complete, Gemini would be used again to create the clues for all the words. This tool would be a fun and engaging way to supplement one's learning and build a stronger knowledge base.
